Practical 4 is the most difficult one until now.
I did not know clearly about the functions of the commands we learned in class,
and sometimes I forgot some necessary steps,
so I spent much time trying to figure out how to use these commands and rewrite the codes.
Although my operations were not right at the first time, after I tried again, I got everything right in the end.
Understanding the precedure of editing a file and merging branches are challenging.
Copying a file to another directory is also challenging as I have forgotten how to do it.
I think I have to make more notes and review what I have learned after class.
I have a question about git merge.
I used git merge command to merge the branches,
but then it showed that there is a conflict in the file,so the automatic merge is unsuccessful.
What can I do to merge them? And why there is a conflict?
