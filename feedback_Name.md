In the formative feedback,
#Week 4:
  There is no feedback for week 4 practical. Everything was fine and the score was 100, but I deleted an unwanted file (practical 4 guide) in the folder 'Practical4'.


#Week 5:
  In variables.py
  - feedback: did not print the result of 'W == Z for all 4 combinations of X and Y'
  * change: add the function 'print()' to print the result out

  In fibonacci.py
  - feedback: did not display the first 2 values of the Fibonacci sequence
  * change: add the first 2 value (known) in the list 'fibonacci' before counting and appending the rest 11 values to the list
  - feedback: pseudocode was not well documented
  * change: rewrote it in the style of the examples given in the lecture slides that week

  In mysterycode.py
  - feedback: the code did not have a commented line that says what the code does
  * change: add my answer '# Answer: this code prints a random integer that is >=1 and <= 50.' and also note the answer given in the feedback 'Selects a random number between 1 and 100 until a number less than 50 is selected, which is then printed'.

  In r_rate.py
  - feedback: numbers are not correct, something wrong with the formula
  * change: correct the r rate model (when r = 1.1, the newly infected people after this round together with the already infected people would infect 1.1 people per person in the next round and changed my code according to it)


#Week 6:
  In the file for comparing coronavirus infection rates
  - feedback: the code did not display the frequency table that matches the input when the input table is changed
  * change: add the code to calculate the frequency (frequency = one country's case/total cases) and create a frequency dictionary whose keys are countries and values are the frequencies.
