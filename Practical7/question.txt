Question:
  How have new cases and total cases developed over time in Spain?
Line number:
  81-90
Discussion:
  The plot represents how new cases and total cases developed over time in Spain, which is what I expected.
  I used loc twice to select the new cases and total cases separately in Spain.
  I used "plt.plot(a, b, 'b+')" twice to import two sets of data into one plot,
  so the plot shows both new cases and total cases
  and I can choose the color for them separately
  I tried to use it once but the two sets of data came out the same color, which was unclear for the plot,
  so I tried using it twice, and it turned out working.
  I used the "plt.tick_params" to change the fontsize of the x ticks and y ticks.
  I also set the label for both axes and the title of the plot.
