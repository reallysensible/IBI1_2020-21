Findings:
(The alignment scores are defined as the	final	BLOSUM score divided by the sequence length in this script.)
Following are the alignment scores.
For alignment between the sequence for human SOD2 protein (NP_000627.2) and the sequence for mouse SOD2 protein (NP_038699.2):
  The alignment score is 4.91.
  The percentage of identity (how	many	amino	acids	are	identical) is 89.64%.

For alignment between the sequence for mouse SOD2 protein (NP_038699.2) and the random	sequence:
  The alignment score is -1.13.
  The percentage of identity (how	many	amino	acids	are	identical) is 5.86%.

For alignment between the sequence for human SOD2 protein (NP_000627.2) and the random	sequence:
  The alignment score is -1.13.
  The percentage of identity (how	many	amino	acids	are	identical) is 5.41%.


Interpretation:
Both alignment scores and percentages of identity suggest that the sequence for human SOD2 protein and the sequence for mouse SOD2 protein are highly similar.
However, the random sequence is quite different from the two other sequences.
The findings reveal that the sequence of SOD2 protein is highly conserved in human and mouse, which might indicate that the sequence has been maintained by natural selection.
They also suggest that the SOD2 protein of human and mouse are homologous, and the evolutionary distance between human and mouse is likely to be small.
